# Colab_to_markdown
Program that reformats python files automatically generated by Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook to markdown.

## Local Copy
The project can be run locally by following these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
 ``` sh
git clone https://github.com/bogdan-tr/Colab_to_markdown
```
2. Download your Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook as a .py file.
3. Copy and paste the contents of the .py file into MagicConverter.txt
5. Compile and run:
``` sh
javac toMd.java
```
``` sh
java toMd
```

The reformatted output will be in toMarkdown.txt, from which it can be copied and pasted into Obsidian or any other program for viewing markdown.

## Possible Future Updates
- Develop a front-end interface to make the program more user-friendly.
- Add a command line argument where the user can specify the language of the code blocks. This way the program would support other languages, not just Python.
