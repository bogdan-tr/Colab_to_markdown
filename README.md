## Purpose

If you frequently work with Google Colab or Jupyter Notebooks and also use Obsidian or Markdown for documentation, this tool provides a seamless bridge between the two. While Colab offers many conveniences for interactive computing, it does not natively support exporting notebooks to Markdown - a format that excels for structured documentation and knowledge management.

This tool was created out of a passion for high-quality documentation and the need to preserve both the narrative and technical content of notebooks. It is especially valuable in academic and research settings, where Colab notebooks often contain extensive annotations, insights, and runnable examples alongside code.

With a clean, intuitive GUI and just a few clicks, you can now convert auto-generated .py files from Colab into well-organized, readable Markdown. Whether you’re curating notes, preparing tutorials, or maintaining a personal knowledge base, this tool makes the transition effortless and efficient.
