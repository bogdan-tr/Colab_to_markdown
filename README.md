# MagicConverter
Program that reformats python files automatically generated by Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook to markdown. 

## Instructions
1) Download MC.java, toMarkdown.java, and MagicConverter.txt.
2) Download your Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook as a .py file.
3) Open all of the files in a text editor.
4) Copy and paste the contents of the .py file into MagicConverter.txt
5) In the terminal run javac MC.java, followed by java MC.
6) The reformatted output will be in MagicConverter.txt, from which it can be copied and pasted into Obsidian or any other program for viewing markdown.

## Possible Future Updates
- Develop a front-end interface to make the program more user-friendly.
- Add a command line argument where the user can specify the language of the code blocks. This way the program would support other languages, not just Python.
