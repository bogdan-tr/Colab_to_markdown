## Local Copy
The project can be run locally by following these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
 ``` sh
git clone https://github.com/bogdan-tr/Colab_to_markdown
```
2. Download your Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook as a .py file.
3. Copy and paste the contents of the .py file into toMarkdown.txt
5. Compile and run:
``` sh
javac toMd.java
```
``` sh
java toMd
```

The reformatted output will be in toMarkdown.txt, from which it can be copied and pasted into Obsidian or any other program for viewing markdown. The code blocks will be in Python by default.

### Optional Command Line parameters
If no command line arguments are passed, Python is the default language for the code blocks. However, the code block language can be changed via command line arguments.

#### Example:
``` sh
java toMd Julia
```
_The code blocks will be in the Julia language._

A second command line argument can be passed (literally anything) to make the output passed to NewtoMarkdown.txt instead of overwriting toMarkdown.txt. Please note that language must be specified first.

#### Example:
```sh
java toMd python new
```
_The code blocks will be in Python and the output will be in NewtoMarkdown.txt. The content pasted into toMarkdown.txt will be preserved._

## Possible Future Updates
- Develop a front-end interface to make the program more user-friendly.
